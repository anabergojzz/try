# csvis - visualise and edit CSV files

Simple terminal program to quickly visualise CSV files in tabular form.  
Uses vi-style motions and modal editing (Normal/Visual/Insert modes).
It is inspired by text editor [`Vis`](https://github.com/martanne/vis).  
For additional functionality you can pipe selected fields to/from/through external programs.

## Build
```sh
cd makefile_folder
make
```

## Examples for piping selection
```
< seq 10                      # Insert sequence
< cat data.csv                # Insert file
| bc                          # Pipe through calculator
| tr a-z A-Z                  # Uppercase conversion
| sed 's/\./;/g'              # Replace dots with semicolons
> wc                          # Pipe to wc to count lines
e > a=[1,2,3]                 # Write to named pipe (e.g. python repl - pyrepl script)
Ctrl-O|{print $1*2}           # Pipe to awk program
```

## Bugs
- error when yank -> undo -> paste
- errors when inserting wide characters at the end of line
- inserting text when screen is full

## TODO
- [ ] Change delimiter
- [ ] leave file structure (without adding separators) if changing only fields that exist (!= NULL)
- [ ] vi movements page down, up, H, M, L, zz, zt, zb
- [ ] add commands (:q, :w)
- [ ] struct for display state (scr_x, v_y, y)
- [ ] search
- [ ] how to calculate sum?
- [ ] mouse support
- [ ] multi select?
- [ ] show full width of cells
- [ ] enumerate
- [ ] "." to repeat
- [ ] how to mark chosen area (yank 5.4,2.10)
- [ ] generalise send to named pipe
- [ ] do not overwrite if original file has changed while editing
