# Csvis - visualise and edit csv files

Simple terminal program to quickly visualise CSV files in tabular form.
Uses vi-style motions and modal editing (Normal/Visual/Insert modes).
It is inspired by text editor [`Vis`](https://github.com/martanne/vis).
For additional functionality you can pipe selected fields to/from/through external programs.

## Build
```sh
cd makefile_folder
make

## Documentation
- For all commands see beginning of main.c file.
- Usual vi letters for navigation
- I,A,o,O for inserting columns/rows
- V-l, V-j for selecting entire column/row
- >,|,< for pipes, e for named pipe (for pipe to repl with memory - for example pyrepl)
- :n.m move to n-th column and m-th row.
    
## Examples for piping selection
    | bc
    | tr az-AZ
    | sed s/\./;/g
    Ctrl-O|{a=$1+$2; print $0,a}
    > wc
    e > a=[1,2,3]
    < seq 10
    < cat data.csv
    draw diagram with matplotlib

## Bugs
    - error when yank -> undo -> paste
    - errors when inserting wide characters at the end of line
    - inserting text when screen is full

## TODO
    - Change delimiter
    - leave file structure (without adding separators) if changing only fields that exist (!= NULL)
    - vi movements page down, up, H, M, L, zz, zt, zb
    - add :q, :w
    - struct for display state (scr_x, v_y, y)
    - search (grep?)
    - how to calculate sum?
    - mouse support
    - multi select?
    - show full width of cells
    - enumerate
    - "." to repeat
    - how to write chosen area (yank 5-4,2-10)
    - generalise send to named pipe
